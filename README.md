# Qonto Technical Test - Backend Engineer Intern

## Introduction

Hi Qonto Team,

My name is Aymene, and I am currently working at Veepee. I am excited to submit my final test for the Backend Engineer Intern position at Qonto. This project was both challenging and rewarding, and I’m pleased to share the results with you.

I’ve implemented a series of backend functions and exposed them via RESTful endpoints. The application has been deployed and is accessible at [https://qonto-technical-test.fly.dev](https://qonto-technical-test.fly.dev). Below, you'll find detailed information about the implementation, including the exposed endpoints, deployment details, and testing.

## Project Overview

This project includes:

- **Dockerized Environment:** The application runs in a containerized environment using Docker.
- **Unit Testing:** Comprehensive unit tests to ensure the correctness of each function.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment are handled via GitHub Actions.
- **Monitoring:** A Grafana dashboard is set up for monitoring the application.

## Endpoints

### 1. Health Check

**Endpoint:** `GET /health`

**Description:** Checks the health status of the service.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "OK"
}
```

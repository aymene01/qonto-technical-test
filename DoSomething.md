## Detailed Breakdown of the `DoSomething` Function

The `DoSomething` function performs several key operations:

- **Validates** the IBAN.
- **Disables** database timeouts to prevent query delays.
- **Recalculates** transaction balances starting from a given date.
- **Locks** the account record for update.
- **Fetches** and **updates** the account balance, handling potential errors if records are not found or updates fail.

The function ensures that account balances are accurate and up-to-date by executing these steps within a transactional context.

**Function Name: `UpdateAccountBalance`**

This function can be renamed to `UpdateAccountBalance` to better reflect its purpose of managing and updating account balances.
